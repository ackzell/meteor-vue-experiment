# Meteor app with vue 2.x and routing (updated)

This is an attempt to use `Meteor 1.4.2.3` and `Vue to 2.1.6` by leveraging [akryum:meteor-vue-component](https://github.com/Akryum/meteor-vue-component)

The app itself was built using the code from [https://github.com/Akryum/meteor-vue2-example-routing](https://github.com/Akryum/meteor-vue2-example-routing).

## Usage

1. Make sure you have [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install) installed locally.
2. Clone this repo (and cd into the new folder):

    `$ git clone https://github.com/ackzell/meteor-vue-experiment.git && cd meteor-vue-experiment`

3. Install the `npm` dependencies

    `$ meteor npm i`
    
4. Start your meteor app

    `$ meteor`
    
You can now visit [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) and start modifying the app.
