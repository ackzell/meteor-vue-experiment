# Meteor app with vue 2.x and routing (updated)

This is an attempt to use `Meteor 1.4.2.3` and `Vue to 2.1.6` by leveraging [akryum:meteor-vue-component](https://github.com/Akryum/meteor-vue-component)

The app itself was built using the code from [https://github.com/Akryum/meteor-vue2-example-routing](https://github.com/Akryum/meteor-vue2-example-routing).
